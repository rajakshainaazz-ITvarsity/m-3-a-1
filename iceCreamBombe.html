                    <h2>Steps</h2>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Line a 9-inch diameter glass bowl with enough plastic wrap to hang over the edges by 6 inches (15 ¼ cm) all the way around. You may have to use more than one piece of plastic.</li>
                        <li>Add the softened ice cream to a medium bowl. Mix with an electric hand mixer until smooth.</li>
                        <li>Transfer the softened ice cream to the prepared glass bowl and smooth the top with a rubber spatula so the ice cream is about 1½ inches (4 cm) from the rim of the bowl. Reserve any leftover ice cream in the freezer. Gently press another piece of plastic wrap over the ice cream to prevent freezer burn and freeze for at least 8 hours, up to overnight.</li>
                        <li>Make the vanilla cake: Arrange a rack in the center of the oven. Preheat the oven to 350°F (180°C). Line a 9-inch (23-cm) round cake pan with parchment paper and grease with nonstick spray.</li>
                        <li>In a liquid measuring cup or medium bowl, mix together the buttermilk, vegetable oil, and vanilla.</li>
                        <li>In a separate medium bowl, sift together the flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt.</li>
                        <li>In a large bowl, combine the granulated sugar, brown sugar, and butter. Beat with an electric hand mixer on high speed until light and fluffy, about 4 minutes.</li>
                        <li>Add the eggs, 1 at a time, and the egg yolks, beating between each addition. Continue beating until almost doubled in volume and very light and fluffy, about 5 minutes.</li>
                        <li>With the mixer on low speed, gently beat in a third of the flour mixture. Before it's fully combined, add half of the buttermilk mixture. Repeat with another third of the flour, the remaining buttermilk mixture, and the remaining flour and mix until well-blended and no lumps remain. Pour the cake batter into the prepared pan.</li>
                        <li>Bake for 45-50 minutes, rotating the pan halfway, until the cake is golden brown, pulling away from the sides of the pan, and the top springs back slightly when pressed. A cake tester or toothpick inserted in the center should come out clean.</li>
                        <li>Remove the cake from the oven and let cool for 5-10 minutes. The cake should still be very warm, but cool enough to handle. Remove the cake from the pan and place pan-side down on a wire rack or cutting board. Slice the domed top off the cake and discard or save for another use.</li>
                        <li>Remove the ice cream bowl from freezer and peel back the top layer of plastic wrap. Gently flip the cake upside down, placing the still-warm, cut side of the cake down on top of the ice cream. It should fit snugly inside the rim of the bowl. Gently press the cake down to ensure it makes full contact with the ice cream. Cover again with plastic wrap and return to the freezer for at least 6 hours, up to overnight.</li>
                        <li>Remove the ice cream bowl from freezer. Fill a slightly larger bowl about ⅓ of the way with hot water. Carefully lower the ice cream bowl into the hot water, ensuring that the water line is well below the rim of the bowl so it doesn't spill over.</li>
                        <li>Set a wire rack inside a baking sheet. Peel back the plastic wrap and carefully invert the ice cream bowl onto the center of the wire rack. Remove the bowl and plastic wrap.</li>
                        <li>Using the hot water in the larger bowl, warm an offset spatula for a few seconds. Use the spatula to smooth out any creases in the ice cream left by the plastic wrap. The surface of the ice cream should be as smooth as possible. If there are any gaps between the ice cream and cake, fill in with the leftover ice cream. If the ice cream has started to melt at all, return to the freezer until completely frozen again, 1–2 hours.</li>
                        <li>Make the chocolate glaze: Add the chocolate, butter, and corn syrup to a medium microwave-safe bowl. Microwave in 30-second intervals, whisking between, until completely melted. Whisk vigorously until glaze is smooth and glossy. Let cool to about 100°F (38°C), or just warm to the touch, before using.</li>
                        <li>Pour the chocolate glaze directly over the top of the ice cream dome in one continuous pour, using a spatula to ensure the chocolate leaves the bowl quickly. Ensure the bombe is covered completely by swirling the chocolate in a 2-inch circle over the top center of the dome.</li>
                        <li>Let the bombe sit at room temperature 5-10 minutes for the ice cream to soften slightly and the glaze to set, or place in the refrigerator for up to 30 minutes. If serving more than 30 minutes later, return to the freezer, then let the bombe thaw at room temperature for 15-20 minutes before slicing and serving.</li>
